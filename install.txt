These installation instructions are for OpenIMS CE (Community Edition) only. 
Additional and different requirements apply to OpenIMS Enterprise Edition!

If you have any questions or need help please visit our forum at
http://www.openims.com/phpbb/ so we can help you.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE
* Apache 1.3, 2.0 or 2.2
* PHP 4 or 5 (max 5.4)
* zip, unzip, gzip, gunzip, diff utilities

CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
* OpenIMS must be installed in the DocumentRoot. OpenIMS will not work when 
  installed in a subdirectory under the DocumentRoot.
* OpenIMS must have full write access to the DocumentRoot. Ownership (by the 
  user that Apache runs as) is recommended.
* OpenIMS must be allowed to use the command line utilities listed above and 
  to use the shell. 
  SELinux or other software that would interfere with this, should be disabled
  (at least for Apache).
* mod_php is recommended. When not using mod_php, the PHP settings listed in 
  the included .htaccess file should be transferred to php.ini.
* The Apache directive "AllowOverride All" is required.

QUICK INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
1 Unzip OpenIMS in the DocumentRoot. If you are not unzipping, but copying or
  moving files, make certain that .htaccess is included.
2 Use "chown" to transfer ownership to the Apache user. Example:
  chown -R apache:apache /srv/www/openims
3 Access the server with a web browser (using the correct domain name if 
  VirtualHosts are being used).
4 You should be redirected to http://<<<hostname>>>/openims/ce/autoconf/ and 
  receive an error page instruction you to add your IP-adres to
  <<<DocumentRoot>>>/openims/ce/autoconf/.htaccess. Do this.
5 Refresh the page in your web browser. You should now be able to create
  a basic site and set a password.
6 After creating the site, remove your IP-adress from 
  <<<DocumentRoot>>>/openims/ce/autoconf/.htaccess.
7 Visit the url http://<<<hostname>>>/adm to log in to OpenIMS.
8 Use Admin > Maintenance to check and/or repair your Myconfig.php 
  configuration.

MYCONFIG CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
Myconfig.php should appear in the DocumentRoot after step 5 of the Quick
Install Instructions. You should change the settings in myconfig.php to match
your Linux configuration.

*** Default settings created during the installation:

$myconfig["windows"] = "no";
// Dont change this

$myconfig["linux"] = "yes";
// Dont change this

$myconfig["tmp"] = "/tmp/";
// This should be a directory where Apache has write access

$myconfig["hasgzlib"] = "yes";
// Tells OpenIMS whether certain PHP functions are available.
// If the selftest (Admin > Maintenaince > Check configuration) results in
// a (fatal) error, change this setting to "no".

$myconfig["hasgzcompress"] = "yes"; 
// Tells OpenIMS whether certain PHP functions are available.
// If the selftest (Admin > Maintenaince > Check configuration) results in
// a (fatal) error, change this setting to "no".

$myconfig["gzipcommand"] = "/bin/gzip";
// Should contain the path to the gzip executable.

$myconfig["gunzipcommand"] = "/bin/gunzip"; 
// Should contain the path to the gunzip executable.

$myconfig["tarcommand"] = "/bin/tar"; 
// Should contain the path to the tar executable.

$myconfig["localsendmail"] = "yes";
// Tell OpenIMS to use the standard PHP mail() function. Don't change this,
// as there are no alternatives available in OpenIMS CE.

$myconfig["diff"] = "/usr/bin/diff"; 
// Should contain the path to the diff executable.

$myconfig["unzip"] = "/usr/bin/unzip"; 
// Should contain the path to the unzip executable.

$myconfig["zip"] = "/usr/bin/zip"; 
// Should contain the path to the zip executable.

*** Optional settings that you might want to add

$myconfig["nosendmail"] = "yes";
// Disable alle mail functionality.

$myconfig["defaultlanguage"] = "en";
$myconfig["defaultlanguage"] = "nl";
// Configure the default language (English or Dutch).

$myconfig["antiword"] = "/usr/bin/antiword"; // (see below)

INSTALLING ANTIWORD (OPTIONAL)
Antiword is required to compare historical versions of .doc documents. Without
Antiword, the compare buttons will not be available. Using antiword will also
improve the quality of full text searching.

1 Install antiword. Example: yum install antiword.
2 Use "which antiword" to find out where antiword is installed, and add the
  result to myconfig.php. Example: $myconfig["antiword"] = "/usr/bin/antiword"; 
3 Make certain that the Apache user has permission to run antiword. 
  Example: chmod 755 /usr/bin/antiword
4 Use Admin > Maintenance to check and/or repair your Myconfig.php 
  configuration.
5 To benefit from improved searching, use Admin > Maintenance to regenerate
  the full text indexes.

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
* If images and short url's (a short url would be http://<<<hostname>>>/adm 
  instead of the full url http://<<<hostname>>>/openims/openims.php?mode=admin)
  are not working, this usually means that .htaccess is not present / has a 
  syntax error / is not being read by apache; check your AllowOverride-settings
  is httpd.conf.
* To view OpenIMS errors (including many errors related to the configuration 
  of php), go to http://<<<hostname>>>/showerrors, enable the "Show Errors"
  option, and then reload (Ctrl+F5) the page you were trying to view.
* If (with /showerrors) you get the php error "headers already sent", check 
  that you do not have any whitespace before <? or after ?> in myconfig.php 
  or in your site configuration.
* Go the the OpenIMS-directory and do "php -f myconfig.php" on the command 
  line, to verify that there are no syntax errors in myconfig.php.
